# capstone

## Usage

On each of your tablet and desktop, clone into `capstone` and run:

```console
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Again on each device, open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`. Select "Load
unpacked". For the tablet, select `capstone/dist/capstone`, for the desktop,
`capstone/dist/sidecar`.

You should then be able to open Sidecar on your desktop and Capstone on your
tablet as you would other apps on those platforms.

When the data format changes, you may need to "Remove" the apps from
`chrome://extensions` and re-install them, clearing your data in the process.

To pair your desktop sidecar with your tablet app, get a console in your tablet
app (long-press, "Inspect"), and then type:

```js
> chrome.storage.local.get('workspaceUrl', console.log)
{workspaceUrl: "capstone://Workspace/..."}
```

Send this URL to your desktop out of band. Open your desktop sidecar, paste the
URL into given form, and hit Enter.

To use the sidecar:

* Drag files from your desktop into the space with a "+" to add files to your
  archive.

To use the tablet app:

* In a document, three-finger-swipe from the top of the screen to open the
  archive
* In board or archive, double-tap to navigate into a doc
* In board, stylus inks by default
* In board or archive, hold Ctrl to gesture with stylus
* In archive, gesture a rectangle to create a new board
* In board, stylus-double-tap to create a new text card
* In archive or board, gesture an up carrot to copy an item to your shelf
* In board, gesture a down carrot to place item(s) from your shelf
* In archive, board, or shelf, gesture an X to remove an item
* In a document, pinch-zoom-out to navigate back

To send your identity to another user, navigate to your identity card, press
Ctrl-C, and send the URL copied to your clipboard to the other user out of band.
They can then Ctrl-V in their archive to make your user card appear.

## Dev tools

`yarn start`: Start the build
`yarn clean`: Delete `dist/*` for a clean build
`yarn test`: Same as `yarn launch-tests`
`yarn repl`: Start a TypeScript REPL
`yarn format`: Format all `src/*` code with prettier
`yarn launch-capstone`: Open the "capstone" chrome app. Run `yarn start` first
`yarn launch-sidecar`: Open the "sidecar" chrome app. Run `yarn start` first
`yarn launch-tests`: Open the "tests" chrome app. Run `yarn start` first

We're using [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
It should be recommended in the extensions tab of VSCode, and there is
support for [other editors](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) as well.
Otherwise, you can format the code by running `yarn format`.

## Widgets

Widgets are React components that handle the rendering and construction of a document.

A widget component is required to accept two props:

- `url` is a document URL of the form: `capstone://Image/5M23ked3t3UBQGDS5uDqWVNsffebBhmo3PjguECRt7xH/HDP`
- `mode` is a string enum informing the widget how it's expected to render<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. Possible values are:
  - `"fullscreen"`: the widget is full screen.
  - `"embed"`: the widget is embeded in another document (e.g. on the board).
  - `"preview"`: same as "embed", but the widget should not expect user interaction.

### Using a widget

Given a document URL, a widget can be rendered using `Content`:

```typescript
<Content url={url} mode="preview" />
```

### Building a widget

Every widget must implement a `static reify(doc)` method which translates a
free-form document which you hope contains your data into a definitive data
structure you can render. The reify method helps to guarantee that later in
your code you won't encounter runtime errors caused by unexpected `null` or
`undefined` fields or subfields.

To make widgets easier to build, a base `Widget` class is provided.
A basic widget looks like this:

```typescript
import * as React from "react"
import Content from "./Content"
import Widget, { Doc, AnyDoc } from "./Widget"

// These are the properties we expect our document to include
interface Model {
  count: number
}

export default Counter extends Widget<Model> {
  static reify(doc: AnyDoc): Model {
    return {
      count: Content.number(doc.count, 0), // Content.number ensures that doc.count is a number, and provides 0 as a default
    }
  }


  show({count}: Doc<Model>) {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.click}>{count}</button>
    )
  }

  click = () => {
    this.change(doc => {
      doc.count += 1
    })
  }
}

Content.register("Counter", Counter) // Register the widget with Content, so other components can render it.
```

## Footnotes

[<a name="footnote1">1</a>]: `mode` is intended to give the widget a general
sense of what it can expect about the context it is rendering into. For example,
a widget receiving `"fullscreen"` can expect that it is (almost) the only thing
rendered on the screen. The widget might then show additional controls, or enable
a richer set of gestures.

Similarly, `"preview"` is informing the widget that it is being rendered as a
preview and will not receive user input events. The widget might hide
interactive controls in this mode.

`mode` is not explicitly saying anything about the _size_ of the widget, which
will likely be provided via a separate prop.

## Debug Tools

In the developer console for the backend process some debug tools are available
type
```
  > peek()
```
To see the documents being track by the backend
```
  > peek(docid)
```
To get more info on a single doc
```
  > peek(docid,"p")
```
To get more info on peers and network activity
